                  Hi, I'm Christian Boland Ross - a computer science student and freelance 3D generalist with a strong foundation in both software development and digital media production.
                  I work at the intersection of code and creativity, blending technical problem-solving with visual storytelling.
              </p>
              <p style="font-size: 1.2rem; color: #333;">
                Since 2023, I’ve been freelancing in the VFX space—both independently and as part of Visionary VFX (visionaryvfx.org), a small studio where I’ve contributed to projects across the full production pipeline, from pre-visualization and asset development to compositing and color grading.
                This hands-on experience has sharpened my ability to collaborate effectively, adapt quickly, and deliver high-quality results under tight deadlines.
                <br><br>
                I got in contact with the Owner, my good friend Joel Calorte, and he gave me this reference:

                <blockquote class="blockquote ps-3 border-start border-3">
                “
                <br>
                    Chris is an exceptional professional, consistently approaching every project
                    with dedication and a commitment to excellence. He reliably meets deadlines
                    and delivers work on time, ensuring every project receives his best effort.
                    Beyond his technical skills, Chris is a humble and kind individual, known for
                    his collaborative spirit. His 3D work, in particular, stands out for its outstanding
                    quality and creativity, making him a valuable asset to any team.
                    Best Regards, Joel Calorte
                    Owner of Visionary Studios
                <br>

                My core tools include Blender for 3D work and DaVinci Resolve (Fusion) for editing and compositing.
                I also have working knowledge of After Effects, Houdini, Nuke, Substance Painter, and Unreal Engine.
                While my current focus is on 3D/VFX, my background in computer science gives me an edge when it comes to scripting, pipeline automation, and understanding the technical side of production tools.
                I'm always looking for opportunities that push both my creative and technical boundaries.
